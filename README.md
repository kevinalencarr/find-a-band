# What this is

This is a web app I'm currently developing to improve my skills with MVC and .NET in general.

With Find-A-Band, musicians can find ads for bands currently looking for new members.

# Steps taken (so far)

This is a work in progress. Updates will be put here as development takes its course.

### 1. Models created
Models were made for *users*, *bands*, *addresses* and *ads*. Also, enums for *ad categories* and *band genres* were created.

### 2. DbContext configured
DbContext configutarions were done, migrations were successfully made and server is ready to go. Used Docker and SQL Server.

# Tools used

- Currently using Visual Studio 2022
