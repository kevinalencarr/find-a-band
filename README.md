# What this is

This is a web app I'm currently developing to improve my skills with MVC and .NET in general.

With Find-A-Band, musicians can find ads for bands currently looking for new members.

# Steps taken (so far)

This is a work in progress. Updates will be put here as development takes its course.

### 1. Models created
Models were made for *users*, *bands*, *addresses* and *ads*. Also, enums for *ad categories* and *band genres* were created.

### 2. DbContext configured
DbContext configurations were done, migrations were successfully made and server is ready to go. Used Docker and SQL Server.

### 3. Controllers and Views added
Controllers for *bands* and *ads* were made, as well as the Views for these pages. Data was seeded to test the Views.

# Tools used

- Visual Studio 2022, as IDE
- Entity Framework, for migrations
- Docker, to set up connection with SQL Server
